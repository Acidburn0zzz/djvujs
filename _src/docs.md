# Documentation

The profound and intelligible documentation, describing API of the DjVu.js library and the viewer, must be here, 
but as you may see - there is nothing :)

The library is by no means well known and I have doubts that it's worth writing the documentation, since nobody except for me uses the library. 
I decided that I will write the documentation later or when somebody asks me to do it. So if you want to use the library and need the documentation, [create
an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/RussCoder/djvujs/issues) or just write me at djvujs@yandex.ru (if I don't response - create an issue).

The technical documentation (how to build the library locally and so on) is available [on GitHub](https://github.com/RussCoder/djvujs/wiki/DjVu.js-Documentation)

The short guide how to try out the viewer locally is on the [Downloads page](downloads)

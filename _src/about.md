# About DjVu.js

DjVu.js is a program library for working with djvu online. 
It's written in JavaScript and can be run in the web browsers without any connection with the server.
DjVu.js can be used for splitting djvu files, rendering pages of djvu document, 
converting (and compressing) images into djvu documents and for analyzing of meta data of djvu documents.

The library is only being developed and may be noticeably changed in the future.
It was completely written and is maintaned by me.

In order to demonstrate the abilities of the library, I decided to create the DjVu Viewer. 
The main idea is to create a plug-in that will be easy to include to any web page.
DjVu Viewer now is very simple and can't do much, but I hope to imporve it a lot in the future. 

If you have any questions, feel free to create an issue on GitHub, or write me on the email.
My address is RussCoder@yandex.ru

If you have a djvu document that can't be rendered by the DjVu Viewer, please send it to me.
It's very important, since the djvu format is quite complicated and I didn't tested all code of my library, 
since I just don't have appropriate examples of djvu files. 

And, of course, any contribution is welcome :)
